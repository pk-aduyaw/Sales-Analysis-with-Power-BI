    "### 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we aim to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution leveraging transactional data from 2019 to provide valuable insights for our client. The client has collected data throughout the year but hasn't utilized it effectively to drive sales and improve operational efficiency. Our goal is to analyze the data comprehensively and present actionable insights that will enable the client to identify opportunities for growth and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Objectives\n",
    "The main objectives of this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the 2019 transactional data to determine the total revenue generated throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify any seasonal patterns or trends in sales to understand the seasonality of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the best-selling and worst-selling products based on sales volume and revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare sales performance across different months or weeks to identify trends and fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of product deliveries across cities to identify key markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare product categories in terms of revenue generated and quantities ordered to understand their contribution to overall sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Analytical  Questions\n",
    "1. How much money did we make this year? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can we identify any seasonality in the  sales? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are our best and worst-selling products? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do sales compare to previous months or weeks? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which cities are our products delivered to most? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do product categories compare in revenue generated and quantities  ordered?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Hypothesis\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): The total revenue generated in 2019 is equal to or less than a predetermined benchmark or expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The total revenue generated in 2019 is greater than the predetermined benchmark or expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Methodology\n",
    "To achieve these objectives, we will follow a systematic methodology that includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Retrieve transactional data for the entire year of 2019 from both CSV files (January to June) and the remote database (July to December).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to answer specific questions such as total revenue, seasonal trends, best-selling products, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Visualization: Visualize the findings using charts, graphs, and tables to facilitate understanding and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interpretation and Insights: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to help the client make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Report Generation: Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, findings, and recommendations for the client's reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this methodology, we aim to deliver a robust business intelligence solution that empowers our client to optimize sales strategies, identify growth opportunities, and enhance operational efficiency."
